BEH means BasicEventHandling.

Sometimes we don't know how to manage errors.

Simply returning a number ?
Logging before returning a number ?

BEH provides an elegant way to deal with errors.
Events are declared/defined as objects. We simply raise
event. It is up to the caller to do whatever he wants defining
the behaviour of the raise.

BEH allows to define events in different languages.

An event can transit between processes via Corba.


BEH has been generated with DPO (https://github.com/htalbot/DPOpp)

- Generate projects/solution with dpo.pl

- Build: Batch-build twice (BasicEventSyntaxChecker release is called before
  it is built).

- To push it into a pool, freeze it with dpo.pl (https://github.com/htalbot/DPOpp)
